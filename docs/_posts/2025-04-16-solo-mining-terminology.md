There's many subtleties in solo mining nomenclature that often confuse people.

I think there are two axis here:

1. Who builds the block template?
2. Are block rewards shared between miners?

|------------------------|----------------|-----------------------|
| Block Template Builder | Reward Shared? | Mining Type           |
|------------------------|----------------|-----------------------|
| Miners                 | No             | Solo                  |
| Pool operator          | No             | Solo Pool             |
| Miners                 | Yes            | SV2/DATUM             |
| Pool operator          | Yes            | PPLNS/Tides/FPPS, etc |

Hope this helps. Here's a twitter discussion around this:
